<h4>Barrier Reef Orchestra 2016 newsletter</h4><br>

<br>
<p>‘Welcome to 2016 which is going to be a stellar year for your Orchestra. Already we have our three<br>
major concerts which will include opera, featuring Paul Tabone born in Ingham, but now working the<br>
international stage as a tenor based in Italy. <br>
<br> 
As we look forward to the next milestone for the Orchestra in 2020 it is worthwhile to reflect on the<br>
development and struggles the BRO has endured. In my opinion this is a substantial move forward and<br>
shows the Council’s support is well founded and supported by the public attendance at our concerts.<br>
It is crucial that the support from the Council be maintained into the future to assist BRO to grow.<br>
The funding is not taken as a given and we must all do our bit to let the Council know how important<br>
it is to continue the development of BRO for Townsville audiences and local musicians<br>
<br>
Finally, the AGM is soon to be upon us and there will be some vacancies on the committee.  My reign<br>
of terror will be coming to an end as I will be stepping down, so we will be looking for a new President.<br>
I am flagging this now to allow the search to begin for the next President.  I can assure any prospective<br>
nominees that they will find a willing and dynamic committee at their disposal and a myriad of challenges<Br>
just waiting to be resolved.  I can highly commend this position and would be pleased to speak to anyone<br>
 considering the position.  See you all at the launch. (extract of the 2016 newsletter)’<br>
