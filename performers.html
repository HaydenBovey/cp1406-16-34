				<h4>Orchestra's Information</h4>
				<p>The orchestra contains four main areas - brass, string, woodwind and percussion. Each area has different instruments but they all have some similarity.</p>
				<br>
				<h2>Brass</h2>
				<p>The brass instruments (also know as labrosones) use the vibrations made by the player's lips to create the sounds. Extra tubing using valves or slides make the vibrations travel further and produce lower notes. The velocity of the air stream produces the different harmonics. Brass instruments are defined by the way that the sound is produced and didgeridoos are brass instruments. This section of the orchestra includes trumpets, tubas, bass and tenor trombones, horns and even didgeridoos.</p>
				<h2>Percussion</h2>
				<p>The percussion instruments produce sounds by either being struck by hand or another instrument, scraped or rubbed by hand. These instruments can be either put into a pitched or unpitched class. Some examples of these insturments are cowbells, hi-hat, maracas, bass drums, snare drums, tamtam (gong). There has even been use of unconventional percussion instruments like beer kegs, metal pipes and pots and even car brake drums.</p>  
				<h2>Woodwind</h2>
				<p>Woodwinds produce sound by either blowing onto a reed which causes a vibration or by blowing air into (a recorder is an example of this) or across a cylinder object (such as a  transverse flue) causing the air to split when it meets an open hole. Most woodwind instruments use a small piece of wood called a reed (which is made from either cane or a synthetic material). This vibrates when air is blown over it and some instruments can have more then one reed. These are just some of the many woodwind instruments available - saxophones, flutes, clarinets and bagpipes with some of these having many different subtypes, like contrabass, brass, tenor and alto saxophones are just a few examples.</p>
				<h2>String</h2>
				<p>The string section produce sounds by having the strings vibrate by being plucked, bowed or struck. Banjos, guitars, ukuleles and harps have their strings plucked. Bows are generally used with cellos, violins and violas. Pianos are both a string and percussion instrument. Some of the instruments included in this section are violins, cellos, guitars/electric guitars, bass guitars, harps and banjos.</p>
