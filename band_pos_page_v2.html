						<h1>Welcome to the Orchestra's Information</h1>
							<p>The orchestra has four different main areas, the brass, string, woodwind and the percussion. Each area has many different instruments but they all has some similarity.</p>
						<br></br>
						<h2>Brass</h2>
							<p>The brass instruments (also know as labrosones) use the vibrations made when its used to create the sounds, being either valved or slided to adjust the sounds produced. Not all brass instruments are actually made from brass some examples are didgeridoos and alphorns while instruments from other sections can be made from brass like saxophones .This part of the orchestra includes trumpets, tubas, brass and tenor trombones, horns and even didgeridoos.</p>
						<h2>Percussion</h2>
							<p>The percussion instruments produce sounds by either being struck by hand or another instrument, scraped or rubbed by hand. These instruments can be either put into a pitched or unpitched class. Some examples of these insturments are cowbells, hi-hat, maracas, bass drums, snare drums, tamtam (gong). There has even been use of unconventional percussion instruments like beer kegs, metal pipes and pots and even car brake drums.</p>  
						<h2>Woodwind</h2>
							<p>Woodwinds produce sound by either blowing onto a reed which causes a vibration or by blowing air into (a recorder is an example of this) or across a cylinder object (such as a  transverse flue) causing the air to split when it meets a open hole. Most woodwind instruments used a small piece of wood called a reed (which is made from either cane or a synthetic material) which causes vibrations when blown onto and some instruments can use more then one reed. These are just some of the many woodwind instruments available to use, saxophones, flutes, clarinets and bagpipes with some of these having many different subtypes, like contrabass, brass, tenor and alto saxophones are just a few examples. One of our special members here is Jennifer Bradstreet on the flute.</p>
						<h2>String</h2>
							<p>The string family of instruments using the vibrations of the strings to produce sounds, which can be done by either plucking, bowing or even striking the strings. Plucking instruments include banjos, guitars, ukuleles and harps. Bowing instruments are cellos, violins and violas. While striking includes hammered dulcimer and occasionally violin family instruments. Some of the instruments included in this section are violins, cellos, guitars/electric guitars, bass guitars, harps and banjos are just some of the many instruments. The orchestra has a few special players in this section, Yoshika Masuda from Japan who plays the cello and Leah Li who is on the harp.</p>
